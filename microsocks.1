.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm microsocks
is a multithreaded, tiny, portable SOCKS5 server with very moderate resource
usage that you can run on your remote boxes to tunnel connections through them,
if for some reason SSH doesn't cut it for you.
It is very lightweight, and very light on resources too: for every client, a
thread with a low stack size is spawned.
The main process basically doesn't
consume any resources at all.
It is also designed to be robust: it handles
resource exhaustion gracefully by simply denying new connections, instead of
calling
.Xr abort 3
as most other programs do these days.
Another plus is ease-of-use: no config file necessary, everything can be done
from the command line and doesn't even need any parameters for quick setup.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are supported by
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl 1
Activates auth_once mode: once a specific IP address authorized successfully
with user:password pair, it is added to a whitelist and may use the proxy
without authorization.
This is handy for programs like Firefox that don't
support user:password authorization.
For it to work you'd basically make one
connection with another program that supports it, and then you can use Firefox
too.
This option requires options
.Fl u
and
.Fl P
also to be specified.
.It Fl b Ar ip
Specifies IP address outgoing connections are bound to.
.It Fl i Ar addr
Specifies local address to listen connections on.
Host name or IP address can be
supplied.
Default to
.Cm 0.0.0.0 .
.It Fl P
Specifies authorization password.
This option requires
.Fl u
also to be specified.
.It Fl p
TCP port to listen to.
Default to
.Cm 1080 .
.It Fl q
Quiet mode: suppress logging messages.
.It Fl u
Specifies authorization username value.
This option requires
.Fl P
also to be specified.
.It Fl w
A comma-separated whitelist of IP addresses, that may use the proxy without
authentication. e.g.
.Cm -w 127.0.0.1,192.168.1.1.1,::1
or just
.Cm -w 10.0.0.1 .
To allow access ONLY to those IPs, choose an impossible to guess user:password
combination.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Require authentication for all except two specified hosts.
.Pp
.Dl $ microsocks -w 192.168.1.100,192.168.1.101 -u user -P secret
